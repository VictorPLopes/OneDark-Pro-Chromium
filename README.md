## How to install

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
2. The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking in your browser's menu, then selecting `Extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode by selecting that option at the top of the page.
4. Click on the `Load unpacked` button, then locate the folder where you unzipped the release and select it.

## Support me

If you like this theme, and my work, you can always support me via **[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/victorplopes)**. If I get enough support, I will pay the developer registration fee and publish this theme on the Chrome Web Store.
